        <h2>My Hobbies I enjoy to do</h2>
        <h3>Watching doucmentaries</h3>
        <aricle>
            <p>Since 9th grade I have always been hooked on any kind of true crime doucmentaries. This could be anything like the Gypsy Rose Blanchard Case, Ted Bundy etc. There was one in particular it was on Netflix that invovled a cybercrime and it was very intresting and by far my favorite I wont't go into detail about it though.</p>

        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <article>
            <p>I love learning and watching things about weather. I really enjoy watching livestreams about storms that produce tornadoes. I really enjoy the beuaty in them and how it can look so amazing yet be so destrutive at times. I also love to research weather events that have happend in the past.</p>

        <h3>Calling friends</h3>
        <aricle>
            <p>When I get home I also love to call my friends as during the school day I feel alone lots of the time since with my luck I have barely any friends in any classes. So when I get home I love to just call my friends and get a break from school.</p>
