        <h2>About Me</h2>
         
        <p>Hi, my name is Andrew Conte and I am in 11th grade. I am currntly in computer science. I go to Norwood Norfolk Central School. I really want to do something in computers so I decided to go into computer science. </p>
        <p>In my computer science class we are learning about HTML, CSS, and we are about to begin Javascript. Out of the three I really want to learn more about Javascript cause I really like to do when and if statements. I plan on either being a cyber foresnsic investigator or being a teacher.</p>
         <p>The only downside of computer science is probably how bored I get because of the phone ban and I just seem to be the odd one out of the class. But outside of the class I do enjoy listing to true crime doucmentaries.</p>
